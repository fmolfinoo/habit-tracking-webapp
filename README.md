## Introduction 
Welcome to our habit tracking tool! It's time to turn those resolutions into reality. Our tool is here to help you track changes related to your task and see if they really help you stick to your habits.
## Description of the tool:
The tool tracks changes related to a task and helps evaluate the effectiveness of those changes in maintaining the habit. We define a change as a moment in time when you did something important related to that task that could change how effective you are at completing that task in the future. It consists of two elements the title (what you did) and the date (when you did it). For example: if your habit is exercising an example change could be that you got a gym buddy on 17 of February of 2022(02/17/2022). The purpose of my tool is to let you track those changes and see if they were effective as well as well as how successful you were at maintaining the habit on some common timeframes (the last 7,14,30,90, 180 and 360).

#### The Trends Section: 
This section let you see how well you performed in the selected task by displaying your performance on a visual way via plots. The plots currently available are graphs bar, line with raw data and line moving average. The timeframes that we can use for the graph go since the date we make a change or some common timeframes the last 7,14,30,90, 180 and 360 days.

#### Note:
1) **The tool does not contact any other server other than the habitica one and process all the information locally.**
2) To logout simply close all opened windows of the tool.
3) If a task was created after the start of a timeframe of a graph. For example, we created the task this week, and you check the last 30 days of performance you will only get the result of this week or the performance since creation on both the plots and graphs in this application.
4) The moving average shows the average performance from the start of the timeframe until each point on the graph. For example, in point 5 we have the average of the first 5 points and on 6 of the first six and so on. This is useful be able to more easily visualise changes in the trend of your performance.
